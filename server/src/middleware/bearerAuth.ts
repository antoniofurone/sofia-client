/**
 * Bearer-token compatibility shim for the session cookie.
 *
 * Some environments (e.g. Sofia Chat embedded in a third-party iframe, such as
 * the Salesforce/BCAME Customer Portal) run in a cross-site context where
 * browsers refuse to persist or send the `sofia.sid` session cookie, even with
 * `credentials: 'include'`. To keep working there, the SPA may instead send
 * the session id it got from `/api/auth/exchange` as `Authorization: Bearer
 * <sessionToken>`.
 *
 * This middleware runs *before* `express-session` and, when a Bearer token is
 * present and no `sofia.sid` cookie was already sent, synthesizes the exact
 * signed cookie value express-session would have produced for that session id
 * and injects it into `req.headers.cookie`. From that point on,
 * express-session loads/saves the session from the same Postgres store exactly
 * as it does for a normal cookie-based request — no other code (requireAuth,
 * routes, session typings) needs to know the difference.
 *
 * The `sofia.sid` cookie set on the response for cookie-capable clients (plain
 * tabs, same-site embeds, `AUTH_MODE=user`) is completely unaffected.
