/**
 * Minimal security headers relevant to running Sofia Chat inside a
 * third-party iframe (Salesforce/BCAME Customer Portal):
 *
 * - frame-ancestors restricts *who* may embed this app in an iframe.
 *   Configure via FRAME_ANCESTORS (space-separated origins):
 *     - unset/empty (default) → no restriction: any site may embed the app.
 *       Chosen as the default so new integrators work out of the box without
 *       a config change; tighten it (see below) once the set of embedding
 *       domains is known and stable.
 *     - set → ONLY the listed origins may embed the app (plus 'self').
 *   NOTE: leaving this unset removes the app's only defense against
 *   clickjacking (a malicious site iframing the app to hijack an
 *   authenticated user's session) — the sofia.sid cookie's SameSite=Lax
 *   used to provide that defense implicitly, but the Bearer-token fallback
 *   (bearerAuth.ts) that makes cross-site iframes work at all bypasses it.
 *   Set FRAME_ANCESTORS to the known integrator domain(s) as soon as
 *   possible; treat the open default as a temporary/dev convenience.
 * - Referrer-Policy: no-referrer avoids leaking the one-time app_token
 *   (present in the initial iframe URL's query string) to any resource the
 *   page subsequently loads.
